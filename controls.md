Below is a breakdown of what each button on the joystick and controller does:

### PlayStation 4 Controller (con)

- **Left Stick**: Controls the robot's drive direction and speed based on stick magnitude and direction.
- **Right Stick (X-axis)**: Controls the robot's rotation. If auto-aim is active, this input is overridden by auto-aim correction.
- **R1 Button**: 
  - During normal operation, if pressed, the robot prepares to shoot by enabling shooter spinning and carriage preparation. 
  - If the elevator is up, pressing R1 outtakes the note into the shooter assembly without spinning the intake.
- **L1 Button**: Toggles the elevator position between up and down.
- **R2 Button**: Pressed to toggle shooter spinning on and off. It affects the shooter's spinning state and potentially the limelight LED state.
- **L2 Button**: Activates the intake mechanism if the carriage does not already have a ball and the elevator is down.
- **Cross Button**: Activates outtake, running the intake in reverse to expel a ball.
- **POV (D-Pad)**:
  - **Right**: Toggles auto-aim functionality on and off.

### Joystick

- **Button 6**: Stretches the elevator.
- **Button 3**: Lowers the elevator for climbing down.
- **Button 5**: Moves the elevator to a specific position for climbing.
- **POV (D-Pad)**:
  - **0 (Up)**: Moves the elevator up at a raw speed.
  - **180 (Down)**: Moves the elevator down at a raw speed.

### Additional Functionalities

- **Auto-Aim**: This feature automatically aligns the robot's shooting mechanism with a target, utilizing the LimeLight camera for vision processing. It's toggled with the D-Pad right button on the PS4 controller.
- **Shooter Control**: The shooter's spinning state is toggled with the R2 button, affecting whether the robot is prepared to shoot.
- **Elevator Control**: The elevator's position is toggled with the L1 button, and additional control for climbing and positioning is provided through joystick buttons 3, 5, and the POV.
- **Intake and Carriage Control**: The intake system is controlled with the L2 button for intake and the Cross button for outtake. The carriage system is automatically managed based on shooting conditions and elevator position.
